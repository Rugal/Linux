/**
 * Called by classes which make use of a {@link UserDetailsService} to check the
 * status of the loaded <tt>UserDetails</tt> object. Typically this will involve
 * examining the various flags associated with the account and raising an
 * exception if the information cannot be used (for example if the user account
 * is locked or disabled), but a custom implementation could perform any checks
 * it wished.
 * <p>
 * The intention is that this interface should only be used for checks on the
 * persistent data associated with the user. It should not involved in making
 * any authentication decisions based on a submitted authentication request.
